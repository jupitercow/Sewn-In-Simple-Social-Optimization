It is made to be straight forward for users with no confusing extras and no annoying ads. So you can enjoy using it and feel comfortable putting it before a client.

This can be used on its own, but it is more poweful when used with the [Sewn In Simple SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sewn-in-simple-seo/) plugin.

*	Choose which post types it is added to (public post types by default)
*	Integrates nicely with the [Sewn In Simple SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sewn-in-simple-seo/) plugin, so they get merged into one panel for editing

Very simple, no cruft or extra features you won't use.

## Control what post types are added

```php
/**
 * Completely replace the post types in the XML sitemap and SEO edit functionality
 *
 * This will replace the default completely. Returns: array('news','event')
 *
 * The result is to remove 'post' and 'page' post types and to add 'news' and 
 * 'event' post types
 *
 * @param	array	$post_types	List of post types to be added to the XML Sitemap
 * @return	array	$post_types	Modified list of post types
 */
add_filter( 'sewn/seo/post_types', 'custom_sitemap_post_types' );
function custom_sitemap_post_types( $post_types ) {
	$post_types = array('news','event');
	return $post_types;
}
```
